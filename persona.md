# User Persona — Monday Morning Playbook

**Name:** Alex Rivera
**Title:** Partner Success Consultant
**Company:** Solv Health (100 employees, healthcare tech)
**Experience:** Mid-career CSM in a high-context, relationship-driven role

## Background
Alex manages a portfolio of ~15 accounts ranging from $5K to $75K MRR — a mix of enterprise and mid-market urgent care operators. Every Monday, they follow the **Monday Morning Playbook**: pull the BoB Looker report, review week-over-week performance, update open opps, churn flags, and implementation cases in Salesforce, then post 1 key finding + 3 priorities to the `#psc-team` Slack channel.

The problem: assembling that post takes 45–60 minutes of context-switching across Looker, Salesforce, Linear, Slack, and Gong — before Alex can even think about what actually matters.

## Goals
- Start each Monday knowing which accounts need attention and why — before opening a single tool
- Post to `#psc-team` with a sharp, well-reasoned update (not just a task list)
- Spend time on partner relationships, not pulling data

## Pain Points
- Account health signals are scattered across 5+ tools (Looker, Salesforce, Linear, Slack, Gong)
- Risk assessment is mostly vibes-based unless they've recently reviewed the account
- Churn and upsell signals get buried in the week's noise
- Salesforce and Linear updates happen reactively, not proactively
